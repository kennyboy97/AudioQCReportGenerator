Merges TXT document from ProTools markers into Excel QC report template

This code is pretty specific in relation to the QC reports I receive from one particular client.
However, the jist of what is going on can be taken from this code and used with other QC report templates by adjusting row and column values where needed, adding or deleting content where needed (such as my initials).
